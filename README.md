# VRSpatialAudioDemoAndroid
An (incomplete) spatial audio demo for Android (Cardboard)

A VR spatial audio demo for Android. Supports both stereoscopic and monoscopic views. Video player used is ExoPlayer 2.4. VR Rendering done by Spectaculum 1.2.

## Known Bugs
Video player occasionally restarts on playing streaming media.

There is an occasional crash with Stereoscopic View playback that causes the application to restart in Monoscopic mode.

Audio playback is not playing back interactively; That is, when a user pans left or right, the audio is not panning accordingly. Need to fix this.
